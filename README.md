This is a re-write of https://github.com/zeroKilo/AreaServerExplorerWV which was C# implementation of https://github.com/Lord-Ptolemy/lobbyemu

This is a private master server for the .hack Fragment PS2 game. 

Currently this doesn't do a whole lot as I am trying to figure out what alot of the original project did. There wasn't much in terms of commenting in the C# and C++ implementation.

## Features that are currently being worked on:

Database support for MSSQL,MySQL and SQLite

BBS Support

Guilds

Character progression tracking (think of it as character history)
